# Spotify_WhatMakesASongPopular
Spotify is a streaming service that allows you to stream videos, listen to podcasts, and listen to music. It gives you access to millions of playlists, artists, and genres from all over the world that you are able to explore. Most of the songs we listen to today range in a number of ways including songs with low danceability to songs with high danceability depending on our mood or music taste, but how exactly is popularity of a song determined? Popularity of a song, as defined by Spotify, is determined by the total number of plays a certain song has had and how recent those plays are. Therefore, in order to further understand the trends that make up a popular song vs those that make up an unpopular song, we will look into how each feature (attributes that make up a song) relates to how popular a song is and will be in the future. Here, we are going to take a better look at the approach we took in order to achieve this.
